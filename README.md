# Gitlab CI Code Quality Converter
This is a simple tool to convert the output of Qodana to the format expected by Gitlab CI.

## Deprecation
This tool is deprecated in favor of the official [Qodana Gitlab CI Code Quality integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/gitlab.html#gitlab-generate-code-quality-reports).
